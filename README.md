# Week-1
This project uses AI to link pollution control with energy production. It predicts waste, pollution levels, and energy demand, then suggests the best schedule for biogas, waste-to-energy, or CO₂-to-fuel plants. A web dashboard visualizes forecasts, energy output, and pollution reduction for sustainable management.
AI-Powered Green Energy Grid
📌 Project Description

This project aims to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to link pollution reduction with energy production. The system predicts waste availability, air pollution levels, and energy demand using machine learning models. Based on these forecasts, it schedules biogas, waste-to-energy, or CO₂-to-fuel plants to run at the right time, ensuring maximum energy output with minimum resource waste.

A web dashboard is included to display predictions, plant schedules, energy production, and pollution reduction in an interactive and easy-to-understand way. The goal is to support sustainable energy management while addressing environmental challenges like waste accumulation and rising pollution.

🎯 Objectives

Predict waste generation, pollution levels, and energy demand.

Optimize the scheduling of renewable and pollution-to-energy plants.

Visualize forecasts and plant operations through a web dashboard.

Promote sustainable energy use and pollution reduction.
