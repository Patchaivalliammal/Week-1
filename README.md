# Week-1
This project uses AI to link pollution control with energy production. It predicts waste, pollution levels, and energy demand, then suggests the best schedule for biogas, waste-to-energy, or COâ‚‚-to-fuel plants. A web dashboard visualizes forecasts, energy output, and pollution reduction for sustainable management.
